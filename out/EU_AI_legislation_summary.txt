The European Commission has proposed a regulation to establish harmonized rules on artificial intelligence (AI) in the European Union (EU). The aim of the proposed regulation is to create a legal framework for trustworthy AI and to ensure the benefits of AI while upholding fundamental rights and principles. The regulation emphasizes the importance of a balanced and human-centric approach to AI. It sets out a risk-based approach, with certain AI practices and uses restricted or prohibited. High-risk AI systems will need to comply with mandatory requirements for trustworthy AI before being placed on the market.

The proposed regulation applies to high-risk AI systems used in various sectors such as machinery, medical devices, and toys. It aims to ensure the development of trustworthy AI in Europe and aligns with existing EU legislation on data protection, consumer protection, non-discrimination, and gender equality. The proposal strengthens the Union's role in shaping global norms and standards for AI. The legal basis for the proposal is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides for measures to ensure the establishment and functioning of the internal market.

The proposal is the result of extensive stakeholder consultation, including an online public consultation that received contributions from various stakeholders. The consultation highlighted the need for action and the existence of legislative gaps in the field of AI. Stakeholders emphasized the importance of a clear definition of AI and a technology-neutral and proportionate regulatory framework. A risk-based approach was favored, and the use of regulatory sandboxes was seen as useful. There was support for a combination of risk self-assessment and ex-post enforcement for high-risk AI systems.

The proposal aims to address the problems posed by AI development and use, ensure legal clarity, and foster trust in AI in Europe. It sets out specific obligations for providers and users of high-risk AI systems, including conformity assessment procedures, technical documentation, record-keeping, transparency, human oversight, and cybersecurity. Providers of high-risk AI systems will need to establish a quality management system and comply with conformity assessment procedures. Users of high-risk AI systems will have responsibilities such as compliance with instructions, monitoring system functioning, and reporting incidents. The proposal also includes provisions for market surveillance and enforcement mechanisms.

The proposed regulation aims to establish a level playing field for all participants in the AI value chain, both public and private operators. It promotes responsible innovation and protects the interests of all stakeholders while ensuring compliance with regulations. The regulation emphasizes the importance of transparency, accountability, and oversight in the development and use of AI systems. It encourages the establishment of AI regulatory sandboxes to facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems.

The proposal also addresses the processing and handling of personal data in the context of AI experimentation and implementation. It emphasizes the need for data subjects to be protected and their rights upheld throughout the process. Specific measures are outlined to ensure the controlled and secure processing of personal data, including limited access and secure deletion after the conclusion of AI experimentation. The document highlights the importance of documentation, reporting, and transparency in AI projects to ensure accountability and understanding of AI systems' functioning and impact.

The regulation includes provisions for cooperation and coordination between Member States, authorities, notified bodies, and other relevant stakeholders to ensure consistent implementation and enforcement of the regulation. It establishes the European Artificial Intelligence Board to issue opinions and provide guidance on the implementation of the regulation. Financial institutions regulated by Union legislation on financial services will be designated as competent authorities for supervising the implementation of the regulation.

Enforcement mechanisms are included in the proposal, with penalties for non-compliance with the regulations. Member States are responsible for implementing the provisions of the regulation and imposing penalties for their infringement. The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has the authority to impose administrative fines on European Union institutions, agencies, and bodies that violate the regulations outlined in the document.

The proposal also addresses the issue of market surveillance and incident reporting. It requires providers to notify relevant authorities of serious incidents or malfunctioning and establishes procedures for handling non-compliant AI systems in member states. The document emphasizes the need for cooperation, information sharing, and coordination between member states and market surveillance authorities. Access to data and documentation related to AI systems is granted to competent authorities, and specific procedures are established to handle objections and safeguard procedures.

Overall, the proposed regulation on artificial intelligence in the European Union aims to establish a comprehensive legal framework for the development and use of AI systems. It aims to protect health, safety, and fundamental rights while promoting the free movement of AI-based goods and services across borders. The regulation includes obligations for providers of high-risk AI systems and proportionate obligations for users and other participants. It establishes governance systems at the Union and national levels and encourages the creation of voluntary codes of conduct for non-high-risk AI systems. The proposed regulation aims to establish harmonized rules and ensure compliance with existing Union legislation while promoting responsible innovation and protecting public interests and rights.
