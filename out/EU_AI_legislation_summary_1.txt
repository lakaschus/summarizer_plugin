The European Commission has proposed a new regulation called the Artificial Intelligence Act that aims to create harmonized rules for the development, marketing, and use of AI systems within the European Union. This proposal is an effort to balance the potential benefits of AI with the risks and negative consequences it can bring. The regulation seeks to ensure that AI systems are safe, respect fundamental 
rights, and comply with existing laws. High-risk AI systems are defined as those used in critical sectors like healthcare and transportation, and specific requirements are set out for these systems. The regulation also focuses on transparency obligations, governance and enforcement mechanisms, and measures to support innovation. The intent of this proposal is to make the EU a global leader in secure and ethical AI, in line with its broader digital strategy.

The proposed regulation applies to the placing on the market, putting into service, and use of AI systems within the EU. It establishes harmonized rules for AI systems, including prohibitions on certain practices, requirements for high-risk AI systems, and transparency rules for AI systems that interact with natural persons or generate content. It applies to providers, users, and operators of AI systems, regardless of whether they are located within the EU or in a third country. It does 
not apply to AI systems developed or used exclusively for military purposes or to 
public authorities in third countries or international organizations using AI systems for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the EU. Definitions of key terms such as AI system, provider, user, authorized representative, importer, and distributor are provided.

Harmonized standards and common specifications are European standards that help AI systems comply with regulations. Training data is used to teach AI systems to recognize patterns. Conformity assessment procedures verify compliance with regulations, and conformity assessment bodies assess compliance and issue certificates. Notified bodies are designated conformity assessment bodies, and substantial modifications may require re-assessment and re-certification.

CE marking indicates conformity with regulations. Post-market monitoring collects 
data on AI system performance, and registration obligations require providers to register their AI systems. Serious incidents must be reported and addressed, and amendments to Annex I update the list of techniques and approaches. High-risk AI systems are classified based on specific criteria, and amendments to Annex III update the list of high-risk AI systems. Compliance with requirements ensures safety and performance, and a risk management system is necessary for identifying and addressing risks. Data governance ensures relevant and accurate training data, and technical documentation demonstrates compliance. Record-keeping enables monitoring and 
issue resolution. Transparency and provision of information are required, and human oversight aims to prevent risks. Accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity are necessary for safety. Conformity assessment procedures verify compliance, and notifying authorities and notified bodies ensure competence and independence.

The proposed regulation aims to establish a legal framework for AI systems and set requirements for high-risk AI systems, including conformity assessment procedures, common specifications, and presumption of conformity. The regulation also includes provisions for transparency obligations, post-market monitoring, information sharing, market surveillance, and penalties for non-compliance. It encourages the development of codes of conduct and provides for the establishment of an EU database for high-risk AI systems. The regulation also amends existing regulations related to AI systems, such as those on security equipment, safety components, and vehicle type-approval.

The objective of the proposed regulation is to ensure the proper functioning of the single market, create conditions for the development and use of trustworthy AI in the Union, and provide legal certainty for investment and innovation in AI while enhancing governance and enforcement of existing laws. The proposal sets requirements specific to AI systems and obligations on all value chain participants to ensure safety and respect for fundamental rights. It aims to facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe, and trustworthy AI applications and prevent market fragmentation. The estimated financial impact includes operational appropriations for the implementation of the regulation and administrative appropriations for human resources and other administrative expenditure. The proposed regulation is compatible with the current multiannual financial framework and does not require co-financing by third parties.

In addition to the proposed regulation, the provided text includes a list of European Union legislation related to various areas such as pressure equipment, cableway installations, personal protective equipment, appliances burning gaseous fuels, 
medical devices, in vitro diagnostic medical devices, civil aviation security, two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles, agricultural and forestry vehicles, marine equipment, interoperability of the rail system, motor vehicles and their trailers, and systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, and type-approval requirements for motor vehicles and their trailers. It also includes annexes with information on high-risk AI systems, technical documentation, EU declaration of conformity, conformity assessment procedures, and information to be submitted for the registration of high-risk AI systems. Additionally, it includes a list of Union legislation on large-scale IT systems in the area of Freedom, Security, and Justice.

Overall, the proposed regulation and related legislation aim to establish a legal framework 
for the development, marketing, and use of AI systems within the EU. The proposal intends to balance the benefits of AI with its potential risks, ensure safety, respect fundamental rights, and comply with existing laws. It also aims to make the EU a global leader in secure and ethical AI while preventing market fragmentation and providing legal certainty for investment and innovation. The requirements set out for high-risk AI systems, including conformity 
assessment procedures, common specifications, and presumption of conformity, aim to ensure compliance, and transparency and provision of information are required. The proposed regulation is compatible with the current multiannual financial framework and does not require co-financing by third parties.
