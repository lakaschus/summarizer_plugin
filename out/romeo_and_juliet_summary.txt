In Act I, there is a tense encounter between servants of the Capulet and Montague households, which escalates into a fight. Benvolio tries to stop the violence but is drawn into a fight with Tybalt. The Prince arrives and warns the warring families to end their feuds.

In Act II, Romeo and Benvolio decide to go to the Capulets' feast. Capulet discusses the possibility of Paris marrying his daughter Juliet, while a servant is sent to invite certain individuals to the feast. Benvolio advises Romeo to find a new love interest to forget about his unrequited love for Rosaline. The servant encounters Romeo and Benvolio and invites them to the feast. Lady Capulet sends for her daughter, Juliet, and discusses the idea of marriage with her.

In Act III, Juliet is persuaded by Lady Capulet and the Nurse to consider marrying Paris. Meanwhile, Romeo and Juliet meet at the feast and express their love for each other. Romeo climbs over the wall into Capulet's garden, where he eventually reveals himself to Juliet. They discuss their love and decide to get married. Romeo seeks guidance from Friar Lawrence, who agrees to marry them. Mercutio and Benvolio discuss the heat of the day and the possibility of a fight with the Capulets. Tybalt arrives and insults Romeo, leading to a fight in which Mercutio is killed. Romeo seeks revenge and kills Tybalt. The Prince arrives and banishes Romeo.

In Act IV, Juliet is devastated by the news of Romeo's banishment. Friar Lawrence gives her a plan to fake her own death to avoid marrying Paris. Juliet agrees to the plan and takes the potion. The Watch presents the bodies of Paris, Romeo, and Juliet to the Prince, and the Friar confesses his involvement in their tragic fate. The Prince decides to punish some and pardon others, and the Montagues and Capulets resolve to end their feud.

In Act V, Romeo hears of Juliet's death and decides to go to her tomb. He purchases poison from an apothecary and heads to the tomb. Friar Lawrence is informed that his letter to Romeo did not reach him due to quarantine measures. He goes to the tomb to keep Juliet there until Romeo arrives. Paris encounters Romeo at the tomb, and a fight ensues resulting in both Paris and Romeo's deaths. Juliet wakes up, sees Romeo dead, and takes her own life with his dagger.
